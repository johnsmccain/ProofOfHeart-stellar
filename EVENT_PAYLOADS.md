**Sample payload**:
```json
{
  "type": "contract",
  "topics": ["campaign_vote_cast", 42, "GVOTER...ADDRESS"],
  "data": true
}
```

## Client-Side Indexing Patterns

### Pattern 1: Track All Campaigns
```
Listen for: "campaign_created" events
Index: Map campaign_id -> (creator, title, timestamp)
```

### Pattern 2: Track Campaign Contributions
```
Listen for: "contribution_made" events
Index: Map (campaign_id, contributor) -> [amounts]
```

### Pattern 3: Track Revenue Pool Activity
```
Listen for: "revenue_deposited", "revenue_claimed", "creator_revenue_claimed" events
Index: Map campaign_id -> [deposits, claims]
```

### Pattern 4: Monitor Campaign State Transitions
```
Listen for: "campaign_updated", "campaign_cancelled", "campaign_transfer_*" events
Use to trigger cache invalidation and UI refreshes
```

### Pattern 5: Platform Metrics
```
Listen for: "fee_updated", "contract_paused", "admin_updated" events
Use to track platform governance and operational changes
```

## Soroban Event Query Tips

When querying events from a Soroban node:
- Events are indexed by `(contract_id, topic)`
- Filter by the first topic to isolate event types
- Use contributor or creator addresses in topics for user-specific filtering
- Timestamp and ledger info are provided by the node's event API

## Type Information

- `Address`: Soroban contract address (33 bytes)
- `u32`: Unsigned 32-bit integer (campaign IDs, votes, fees in basis points)
- `i128`: Signed 128-bit integer (token amounts)
- `String`: UTF-8 string (titles, descriptions)
- `()`: Empty tuple (no additional data)
